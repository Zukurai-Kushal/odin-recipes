        <em>Description:</em>
        Most recipes for Eggs Benedict called for split and toasted English Muffins.
        However, there is no reason why G.I. white bread can't be used now. Just be sure
        to split your load in half; never cut it with a knife. Don't ask why... it just
        tastes better.
        This is a very simple breakfast dish for two or more, especially if one guy
        prepares the sauce while the other heats the eggs and bread mixture.
