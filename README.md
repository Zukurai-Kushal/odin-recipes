Primary Objective

The primary objective of this project is to learn and practice building
a website using pure HTML, many of the knowledge gained was through the
Odin Project, an open-source project for web development.

Content

I think the aesthetic of a brutalist web design that comes from using pure
HTML would fit right into the style of WW2 recipe cards. So, the content
of this website aims to highlight the diets of the allied forces during WW2. 
"C-Rations" were the predecessors of the MRE eaten by today's military, and
this page contains instructions and illustrations on the typical C-Ration meals.
