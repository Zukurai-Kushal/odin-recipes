            <em>The Charlie Ration (C-Ration)</em> were meals created for the US military during WW2,
            they were the predecessors of the current MRE meals. This website contains instructions 
            and illustrations on the typical C-Ration meals using <strong>The Charlie Ration Cookbook</strong> as
